 * NAME: dl_lists.h
 *              
 * PURPOSE: Include file for double-linked list management functions
 *
 * AUTHOR: T. Habermann, NGDC, (303) 497 - 6472, haber@mail.ngdc.noaa.gov
 *
 * USAGE: #include <lists.h>
 *
 * COMMENTS: Many of the ideas in this generic list handling system
 *              originated in the Vermont Views list management code.
 *
 * The DLL module incorporates self tests when compiled with the symbolic
 * macro DLL_CHK defined.  If you build ANY files with DLL_CHK defined
 * then you must build ALL files with DLL_CHK defined.  Otherwise,
 * different source files will have different opinions as to the
 * contents of a DLL_NODE struct.
