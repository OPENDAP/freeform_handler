Version 3.6.0

Updated rpm spec file using a patch from Patrice Dumas.

Updated the code so that it compiles with libdap 3.6.0.

Version 3.5.0

This version of the FreeForm format handler is essentially the same as the
previous version (3.4) with the exception that it now builds like the other
handlers and works with the dap-server 3.5 base software.
