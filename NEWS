Version 3.7.0

This version of the FreeForm handler includes an executable for use with
Server3 and a shared-object library (aka module) for use with Server4. This
is a source release to support the Server4 1.2 beta release and has not been
tested with Server3, although there should be no problems.

Version 3.6.1

Fixes for Mac OS/X:
1. A compile-time issue was resolved. With Tiger, configure did not set the 
compile-time symbol FREEFORM to the correct value. This caused the compile to 
fail.
2. Since the Mac is a big-endian machine (well, excpet for the new intel macs...)
some of the binary data tests failed. I've marked those as expected to fail so
that the whole suite does not fail beacuse of this.

Note that we are not making binary packages for OS/X, so this will be a source-
only release. These changes will not affect the Linux distributions. The test
changes may affect the Solaris dist, but not in an operational way.

Version 3.6.0

Updated rpm spec file using a patch from Patrice Dumas.

Updated the code so that it compiles with libdap 3.6.0.

Version 3.5.0

This version of the FreeForm format handler is essentially the same as the
previous version (3.4) with the exception that it now builds like the other
handlers and works with the dap-server 3.5 base software.
