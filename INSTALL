To Build the ff-dods servers:

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
type `sh configure'.

2) Type `make' to build the three server programs

3) To install the data server you need to copy the four executables (one
script and three binary programs) named `nph-ff', `ff_das', `ff_dds' and
`ff_dods' to your http server's CGI directory. For many UNIX computers, this
will be named cgi-bin and will reside within the http server's home directory
(e.g., on my system the cgi binary directory is called
/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin). You can find out the name of this directory if
you don't know it by looking in the http server's srm.conf configuration file
(which will be located in a directory called `conf' within the http server's
home directory.

For information about installing secure DODS servers, see the file SECURITY
in DODS_ROOT.

Good Luck :-)
