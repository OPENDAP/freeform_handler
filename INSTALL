BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

0) Please skim REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file before reporting
   problems. Thanks.

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure.'

2a) Type `make' to build the three server programs

2b) Optionally, run the tests by typing `make check' to run the test suite.
    You must have the DejaGNU test software installed on your computer to run
    the tests.

3) Install the server components in $prefix by running `make install.'

Building from Our SVN Repository

  If you are building from a SVN checkout, run 'autoreconf --verbose' before
  './configure; make'. If you try to run autoconf, et c., by hand and wind up
  with build files that don't work, use 'autoreconf --force --verbose'. Once
  autoreconf has made the configure and Makefile.in files, do ./configure;
  make; make install as outlined above.

REQUIREMENTS

  o You need the libdap library version 3.7.0 to build and install this
    software. If you're using Linux, this means either building form source
    or using the libdap and libdap-devel RPM packages.
    
  o To use this software with our data server, you will need the OPeNDAP
    dap-server software package, version 3.6.0 (although for this release,
    operation with Server3 has not been tested).

  o If you're planning on using this with Hyrax, version 1.2, you'll need
    version 3.1.0 of the BES software.

  o The README file has some information about writing the format files used
    to describe data so that it can be served by the software. More complete
    documentation is available in the documentation section of the OPeNDAP
    page at http://www.opendap.org/.

NOTES

  o For information about installing secure OPeNDAP servers, see the file
    SECURITY included with the dap-server software.

  o DEBUGGING AIDS

    - The OPeNDAP libdap library includes the following debugging aids that
      may be of help to you in developing new applications.

    - DBG: simple program instrumentation -- see the file debug.h distributed
      with libdap (which is installed in the libdap header directory; use
      'config-libdap --cflags' and look at the value if -I).

    - DBG2: more elaborate program instrumentation -- by convention this is
      used for output that is half a page or more, while DEBUG is used for
      single line output.
