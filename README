For information about building the FreeForm data handler, see the INSTALL
file.

This file provides basic information about the FreeForm handler and its
configuration. For more detailed information, see the Server Installation
Guide at http://www.opendap.org. Also note that there is also a special
manual for the FreeForm server that covers writing format description files
in detail available at the OPeNDAP web site.

For general information about configuration of the base software for the
OPeNDAP server, see the README that comes with that server and/or the Server
Installation Guide that can be found at www.opendap.org.

A configuration edition helper script, `bes-ff-data.sh' is provided in this 
package for easy configuration of the Hyrax BES server, designed to edit
bes.conf. The script is called like:
   bes-ff-data.sh [<bes.conf file to modify> [<bes modules dir>]]
The `bes-conf' make target runs the script while trying to select paths 
cleverly, and should be called like:
   make bes-conf

Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler Hyrax 
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new install 
and to see how a working bes.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.

dap_ff_handler is a data handler which uses National Geophysical Data Center's
FreeForm/FFND to serve data. The handler requires the OPeNDAP dap-server
software above version 3.7.5. To use with the BES, you'll need BES 3.4.1 or
greater. 

The handler can read binary, ASCII, and dBASE data files using FreeForm/FFND
format descriptions. It can return both array and sequence data types. The
data in the data file is read then served using the appropriate type
according to the format description in the required accompanying format file.

All the data and associated blocks (header information) are
processed. Basic information about the input file is given as Global
Attributes as is any header information. The file's data variables are mapped
into the closest DAP variable type using the FreeForm/FFND external format
file. 

WRITING FORMAT DESCRIPTION FILES

Any data file served must be accompanied by a format description file
(<file_name>.fmt). The format description file defines the formats of headers
and data in the data file. The following shows a few examples of data
description files and their translation into DAP variables, for more
information about format descriptions, please see the OPeNDAP-FreeFrom's user
guide.

1) Format to read a dBASE sequence file 
   
       dbase_input_data "ISEE3_data"
       t 1 15 double 6
       Bx 16 30 double 6
       By 31 45 double 6
       Bz 46 60 double 6
       Bx2 61 75 double 6

   The above format file will map into the following DAP data set:

     Dataset {
       Sequence {
        Float64 t;
        Float64 Bx;
        Float64 By;
        Float64 Bz;
        Float64 Bx2;
       } ISEE3_data;
     } test5;


2) Format to read a binary array file

   binary_input_data "array_in"
   x 1 4 ARRAY["lat" 1 to 10]["lon" 1 to 10] of int32 0
   y 5 12 ARRAY["records" 1 to 10] of float64 15

   The above format file will map into the following DAP data set:

   Dataset {
      Int32 x[lat = 10][lon = 10];
      Float64 y[records = 10];
   } test3;


3) Format to read an ASCII sequence with a file header

      ASCII_file_header "header"
      count 1 2 short 0
      description 4 24 char 0

      ASCII_input_data "data"
      value 1 2 short 0

   The above format file will map into the following DAP data set:

       Dataset {
	  Sequence {
	  Int32 value;
	  } data;
	} test0;

For more examples see the test files in the ff-test subdirectory.
