This file contains information about the DODS-FREEFORM server. 
For information about building and using the software, see the files 
INSTALL and USING. 

DODS data servers make it simple to provide others with direct,
over-the-network, access to your data. There is no need to reformat
your data so that a new system can read it. Instead DODS uses the http server
along with a dispatch script and a set of three server programs (Data
Attribute Server, Data Structure Server, and Data Server) to make your
existing data files available to anyone who has access to a program rebuilt
with DODS components.

For more information about DODS server/client, see the URL

    http://dods.gso.uri.edu

ff-dods is a server implementation of National Geophysical Data Center's
FreeForm/FFND, based on the Distributed Oceanographic Data System. The software
contains data servers that can be used along with any DODS client program to 
process data served by the ff-dods servers.

The server can handle binary, ASCII, and dBASE data files through
FreeForm/FFND format descriptions. It can handle both
array and sequence data types. The data in the data file is read then served
using the appropriate type according to the format description in the
required accompanying format file.

In short, all the data associate blocks (header information) are processed. Basic
information about the input file is given as Global attributes. The file's
data variables are mapped into the closest Dods data model using the
FreeForm/FFND external format file. The data is reformatted to the Dods data
model and served. The user can refer to the entire data variable 
using a URL and/or the local file name. Furthermore, if the user wants 
to work only with a small part of the data set, a constraint expression can 
be supplied along with the URL to save on network data transmission time.
For more information see the file USING.

You can obtain a copy of the latest version of ff-dods software using
anonymous FTP from

    Source files: ftp://dods.gso.uri.ed/pub/dods/DODS-ff-<VERSION>.tar.gz
    Binary files: ftp://dods.gso.uri.ed/pub/dods/binary/<Platform>

    WWW page: http://dods.gso.uri.edu/DODS/home/software.html

To build from the source, You need to have the latest version freefrom and 
maxmin libraries which are distributed with the latest version of DODS 
FreeForm software. You also need the latest version of DODS core
software. The software is available at dods.gso.uri.edu.

Included in this distribution are: 

 - server programs and their dispatch script (ff-dods, ff-das, ff-dds,
 nph-ff)

Questions about ff-dods may be sent to support@dods.gso.uri.edu.

Good Luck :-)
