2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4.

	* Fixed some minor problems with the configure script.

	* Removed some unused code.

	* Fixed a bug in the Date and Time factory classes where the field
	_gmt was shadowed by a local variable with the same name.

	* Updated README & INSTALL.

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged 3.2.3. The next merge should use release-3-2-3 -j
	release-3-2. 

2001-09-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed error reporting bugs (Reza).

	* Added some rudimentary error checking to the date and time
	server side functions.

2001-06-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged head of release-3-2 (tagged release-3-2-2). The next
	merge should use update -j release-3-2-2 -j release-3-2.

	* Factored out the code in read_attributes that extracts
	attributes from data file headers. I also added error trapping so
	that files without headers won't crash the server(!). Also, I
	modified the code which adds the attributes to quote any multiword
	String attributes (using space, \r and \t as separators).

	* Removed calls to find_ancillary_files to locate format
	descriptor files. Use the functions in the FreeForm code to
	perform this function (which happens anyways).

	* Added throw for dates with months outside of 1 through 12.

	* Fixed the DAS tests. They match the new DAS objects which lack the
	long string and which contain datafile header info.

	* Changed the way the DODSFilter is used to support the new
	version request which returns information about the server's
	version (name and number) along with information about the core
	software's version.

	* Changed NULL to 0 in an assignment to _year_base (which is an
	int) because of a g++ warning.

	* Modified date server-side functions to support year/month date
	representations, and to support ISO8601 output formats. (By Dan).
	
	* Merged with changes on the release-3-1 branch. This apparently
	was not done corrrectly the first time around.

2001-01-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Made sure that multiword String attributes are quoted.

	* Fixed a bug in the code that reads datafile headers and dumps
	them into the DAS; Files without a header crashed the server.

2000-08-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-1-7. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-7 -j release-3-1.

	* Merged with Dan's fix for ISO8601 time specs in DODS_Time.cc
	[This happened over onthe release-3-1 branch since the fix wound
	here on the trunk first. I merged it onto the release-3-1 branch
	so I could make a release without getting into the 3.2 code jhrg]

	* Removed all mention of config_dap.h

2000-08-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Tagged this code 3-1-6.

	* Fixed a bug in the test code which made all the tests fail when
	the CWD (.) was not in PATH.

	* Removed use of the config_dap.h header; used config_ff.h in its
	place. 

	* Fixed leap year calculations and condensed then to a pair of
	functions defined in date_proc.c. 

2000-05-01  Daniel Holloway  <dholloway@gso.uri.edu>

	* Added general server-side functions to support
	date-range inventory time variables.
	
2000-04-20  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Changed the FreeForm datatype assigned to dods_byte from int8 to
	uint8. This fixes problems in some datasets. I think, however,
	that FF should be lacks in testing values to see if they fit into
	a byte datatype.

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: cvs update -j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1.

	* Updated the Makefile & configure script. Generic (non-Gnu) make
	utilities should work (although there may still be some rough
	spots). 

1999-08-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a string manipulation error that caused some multi-array
	dataset to return corrupted values.

	* Fixed handling of attributes for files without headers.

	* Changes so that ancillary DAS files use the same naming
	convention as format files.

1999-08-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* This server now reads headers and loads the variables defined
	into the DAS.

1999-05-25  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the spelling of COPYRIGHT and removed dead code.

	* Added security fixes to the nph-ff.in script.

	* Added the decimal year server-side function.

1999-05-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added test-coverage target to Makefile.in

1999-05-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added version.h based version to dispatch script (set by
	configure). 

	* Now uses the 3.0 DAP

	* Switched to the stdc++ string class. 

1999-03-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added support for the Int16, UInt16 and Float32 datatypes.

1999-03-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Format file are now found using a matching scheme that works
	when the filename has dots (.) in it.

1999-02-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The four FreeForm tools newform, bufform, chkform and readfile
	are now built and installing (in DODS.bin) by default.

1999-02-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Generalized the tests so that they work regardless of the server
	version string. Really, this is a fix...

	* Updated to a new version of the FFND library. This version fixes
	the (in)famous stride bug.

1999-01-20  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Updated to a new revision of the FFND library from Mark O. This
	fixes a bug where several int32 fields and one text field in the
	format file would cause server problems. The server would either
	crash or return all zeros and null strings.

1999-01-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Updated the FFND library; Mark O. Made changes and I also made a
	few (minor) changes based on some warnings from gcc.

	* Added tests for the the basic actions of the server plus for the
	DODS_Date, _Time and _Date_time classes and the CE functions that
	provide access to them via CEs. 

1999-01-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Additions for the File Server. This software consists of the
	classes DODS_Date, DODS_Time, and DODS_Date_Time. Instances of
	these classes maybe created using the matching Factory classes
	which in turn read configuration parameters from an ancillary DAS
	object. The objects may be accessed via the CE using functions
	(see the files ce_functions.cc/h).

1998-11-12  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* This code contains an alpha version of the DODS_Date catlaog
	service code.

	* Fixed a problem in DODS_Date where using (mixing) String and
	string caused odd behavior --- extra characters were added to
	strings in odd ways. I removed, for the time being, string from
	the code using the preprocessor (see DODS_Date.h).

	* MAO Found and fixed a bug in sdbin (in the FFND code) that was
	causing the buffer-based FF accesses to fail. The jplpath.dat file
	in ff-tests now works correctly.

1998-09-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed many bugs. 

	* Added a date() CE function. It is a collection of functions,
	waiting to become an object...
