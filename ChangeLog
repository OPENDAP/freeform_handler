	* Generalized the tests so that they work regardless of the server
	version string. Really, this is a fix...

	* Updated to a new version of the FFND library. This version fixes
	the (in)famous stride bug.

	* Updated to a new revision of the FFND library from Mark O. This
	fixes a bug where several int32 fields and one text field in the
	format file would cause server problems. The server would either
	crash or return all zeros and null strings.

	* Updated the FFND library; Mark O. Made changes and I also made a
	few (minor) changes based on some warnings from gcc.

	* Added tests for the the basic actions of the server plus for the
	DODS_Date, _Time and _Date_time classes and the CE functions that
	provide access to them via CEs.

	* Additions for the File Server. This software consists of the
	classes DODS_Date, DODS_Time, and DODS_Date_Time. Instances of
	these classes maybe created using the matching Factory classes
	which in turn read configuration parameters from an ancillary DAS
	object. The objects may be accessed via the CE using functions
	(see the files ce_functions.cc/h).

	* This code contains an alpha version of the DODS_Date catlaog
	service code.

	* Fixed a problem in DODS_Date where using (mixing) String and
	string caused odd behavior --- extra characters were added to
	strings in odd ways. I removed, for the time being, string from
	the code using the preprocessor (see DODS_Date.h).

	* MAO Found and fixed a bug in sdbin (in the FFND code) that was
	causing the buffer-based FF accesses to fail. The jplpath.dat file
	in ff-tests now works correctly.

	* Fixed many bugs. 

	* Added a date() CE function. It is a collection of functions,
	waiting to become an object...
